https://github.com/coessing/coessing-mitgcm-2024/
git clone git@github.com:coessing/coessing-mitgcm-2024

Class objectives:

1. GitHub:
  a) Create a github account and an ssh key to keep track of all your
     work instructions for doing this are under doc/git_tips.txt
  b) Install Linux if your are using a Windows OS
     instructions for doing this are under doc/Ubuntu_on_Windows.txt
  c) Octave installation, including graphics package
  d) MITgcm installation instructions and notes for each laptop/OS
     flavor instructions for doing this are under doc/MITgcm_on_*.txt
  e) Everyone needs to check-in some modification, improvement,
     clarification to github

2. MITgcm:
  a) Install gfortran and MITgcm and run single-processor natl_box
  b) Install MPI and run multi-processor natl_box
  c) Install/run Anyanui Estuary MITgcm configuration

3. Tides:
  a) Obtain TPXO (https://www.tpxo.net/) tidal estimates
     in front of Anyanui Estuary
  b) Based on 2D plots of TPXO model bathymetry and elevations
     near Anyanui Estuary, choose best optimal location
  c) Extract elevation time series at that location

4. Data:
  a) Summarize all available in-situ observations in a table.
  b) Obtain all available snapshots of SWOT coastal sea level
     in Anyani Estuary region, including river and coastal sea level

5. Open channel flows:
  a) Estimate flow and T/S properties of incoming and outgoing channels
  b) Add these flows to MITgcm configuration
  c) Compare simulation with all available observations

6. Prepare and practice group project presentation
  a) Use Google Slides for collaborative development of presentation
  b) Download to odp or pptx format on laptop for presentation,
     to avoid network issues
  c) Understand/discuss the science
  d) Practice, Criticize, Fix, Repeat!
